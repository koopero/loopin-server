This module wraps [horten-server](https://github.com/koopero/horten-server) as
a [Loopin](https://github.com/koopero/loopin) plugin. It allows Loopin applications
to have nice, clean [Horten controls](https://github.com/koopero/horten-control).
Additionally, the following endpoints are made available:

* **GET /loopin/buffer/*.[png|jpg] Retrieve an image from Loopin's buffers.
